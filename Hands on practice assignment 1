#storing relevant data in dataframe women 

women<-data.frame(women)

#Finding the average weight and height of the women in the data frame 

mean.height=mean(women$height)
mean.weight=mean(women$weight)

#finding the nos. of women whose height is greater than average and whose weight is less than the average
#Storing in a new dataframe 
women_df<-subset(women,height>mean.height & weight<mean.weight)

#No such women in the existing database (No data available in table)
